<center><h1 align="center">☕️ OOP - Practical Task Implementations</h1></center>

<p align="center">A GUI wrapper for the all the tasks given in my uni OOP course</p>

## The Problem

- I need to know how to remove the `Script` from `JavasScript`.
- I need to know how OOP works.
- I'm too curious on how to build a GUI app using Java.

## The Solution

So yeah, when other people are still implementing the tasks given by the lecturer in CLI, I decided to go one step further and build a simple GUI app for the tasks.
